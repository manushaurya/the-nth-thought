    <h2>Growth till when?</h2>
    <p>Every day while commuting to my office, I see the damage we as species are making to the ecological system. Sometimes I see kids on the side of the road burning garbage, sometimes unnecessary honking even when there is no need, sometimes the so called Sewage Treatment Plants barely meeting their purpose. I think; what are we doing to the planet. To make my comparison I imagine the life few centuries ago when life was simple without complex machines or harmful chemicals or even the scale of fossil fuels we are using today. Maybe my ancestors used wood to make food, used bullock carts to travel from one place to another, maybe we were slow, maybe they didn't grow crops using all the chemicals they use today, maybe their life was simple. But this is how majority of our ancestors lived ever since the invention of wheel. We didn't create the imbalance on this scale, specially in a short span of last hundred years. How many species of flora and fauna are gone in the last couple hundred years? Whom should this be attributed to? Industrial Revolution? Science? Greed? Concept of money? Unsustainable growth? Maybe we didn't think beyond ourselves. Is it possible to continue to grow year on year for those companies. I look forward to these all questions answered through the human behavior, quickly if possible. Otherwise this unsustainable growth is nothing other than cancer and it will take us down sooner or later.</p>
