    <h3>Few points to remember from the Sam Altman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYMqVwsewSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> on the ycombinator youtube channel</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In order to choose what to work on, pick something in the intersection of "what you're good at", "what you enjoy" and "where you can create value for the world?"</li>
    <li>Simply spending time to help a lot of people, helps identify pockets of people you would like to do a venture with</li>
    <li>Working hard early on in life and leveraging the compound effect is grossly underrated</li>
    <li>When you have run out of ideas and something is not working, then it is the right time to stop working on that project!</li>
    <li>Failures are highly draining, so to stay highly motivated it's important to take breaks when things are not working!</li>
    <li>Ask for what you want!</li>
    <li>History belongs to doers!</li>
    <li>Successful ventures get paid for the massive amount of value they create!</li>
</ul>
