    <h2>Dec 7, 2023</h2>
    <p>When you can't run, walk. When you can't walk, crawl. But keep moving.</p>
    <p>There are situations or challenges which make us like a deer caught in the headlights. Key is to keep evaluating your condition and not getting paralyzed by the challenges. Breakdown the challenge and solve the subproblem. Just don't forget that none of your problems are bigger then you and your mind.</p>
